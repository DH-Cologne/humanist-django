	<h1>Humanist’s editorial intent</h1>

	<hr>

	<p>
		The best way to understand what Humanist is about, what it is for, is to
		subscribe and participate. Looking through the archives may help. But a
		few words concerning what it does and how it goes about doing that will
		fill in the gaps.
	</p>

	<p>
		The subjects discussed on Humanist are determined entirely by its
		membership within the broad interdisciplinary scope of computing in the
		human sciences and, when needed, the sciences beyond them. Postings are
		sent out unaltered except for grouping with others on the same topic and
		the occasional reformatting to improve legibility. Although exchange of
		information relevant to digital practices is a regular feature, the aim is
		to do scholarly research by means of conversation, asking and responding
		to questions, discussing problems, opening them up to new contexts.
		Perhaps the best description is Nick Sousanis’ provisional definition of
		‘unflattening’ in his book of that title: “a simultaneous engagement of
		multiple vantage points from which to engender new ways of seeing" (2015:
		32).
	</p>

	<p>
		Humanist has a very sparse de facto editorial policy that has remained
		unchanged since 1987 but is spelled out here for the first time to avoid
		any misunderstandings.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is this: for practical reasons born of experience, the Editor reserves
		the right to hold back a posting when it does not fit scholarly
		discussion, is ad hominem or poses a Holmesian “clear and present danger”
		of provoking heated exchange likely to overwhelm all else. When the Editor
		intervenes in that way, the author is consulted immediately, but the
		Editor's decision is final. It should be noted that such holding back has
		in the history of Humanist been exceedingly rare thanks to the governing
		communal spirit of this seminar.
	</p>

	<p>
		The one innovation since the move of Humanist to its present home in late
		2020 is its Editorial Board. The purpose of this Board is to guide
		Humanist’s growth and development and to signify the seriousness of its
		playful intent as a form of scholarly publication. The following scholars
		are currently serving as members:
